 <p> My name is Dante LittleHorse James. My background includes many different cultures. 
     I am Native American and Spanish from my mother and Black and German from my father. 
     I was also raised with a heavy Japanese and Korean influence as my father had lived and 
     studied martial arts there. I grew up very quickly as my family was not as fortunate as others
     so I began working at 14. I have worked very hard to excel in everything I do and to follow
     my passions at every point in my life, which has lead me here. I'm an open book and love discussing
     my experiences and past so always feel free to ask about anything!
